# Facial-landmark-detector
Using opencv, dlib library and python

Facial landmarks are used to localize and represent salient regions of the face, such as:
Eyes
Eyebrows
Nose
Mouth
Jawline

Detecting facial landmarks is therefore a two step process:

Step #1: Localize the face in the image.
Step #2: Detect the key facial structures on the face ROI ( region of interest )
